# Pokémon Red and Blue - Enhancement Patches

This is a fork of the Pokémon Red and Blue disassembly which adds some optional
enhancement patches.

Current enhancements available:

* Increase walking speed (always, or only while holding B)
* Use Cut/Surf/Strength directly from the overworld
* Allow more precise control over text delay (0 to 7 frames per letter, with
  option to make 0 the default)
* Disable low health alarm, or make it beep only a few times and then stop
* Improvements to battle screen (more info about selected move, show "caught"
  indicator, etc)
* Allow checking your Pokémon's stats from the "choose a Pokémon" menu in battle
  at all times (normally this option isn't shown if choosing a Pokémon after
  yours or an opponent's has fainted)
* Press left/right to adjust quantity by 10 when buying, selling or tossing
  items
* When buying items, show how many you already have
* Debugging functions (debug menu, walk through walls, no random battles)
* Skip intro (boot directly to title screen)

Planned enhancements:

* Register items to Select button
* Notify when PC box is (nearly) full, and/or allow to change it from anywhere
* Show descriptions of items and moves
* Ability to sort items automatically
* Various menu improvements and bug fixes
* Who knows?

These patches can be toggled on/off by editing `hacks.asm`. With all patches
disabled, the ROM builds identical to the original.
